## SSH session

A SSH session goes through the following steps:
    
    - Before connecting to the server, we can setup if we wish one or other server public key authentication, i.e., RSA, ED25519 or ECDSA. We must of course set up the hostname

    - The connection is established, a secure handshake is made, and resulting from it, a public key from the server is gained. We must verify that the public key is legitmate, using for instance the MD5 fingerprint or the known hosts file.
    
    - The client must authenticate: the classical ways are password, or public key(from ecdsa, ed25519 and rsa key-pairs generated by openssh). If a SSH agent is running, it is possible to use it.
